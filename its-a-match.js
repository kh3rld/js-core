/*
Have you been been pondering over the etymology of grep?

Create 4 regular expression variables:

    normal: matches with the expression 'hi'.

    begin: matches with the expression 'hi', only when it is at the beginning.

    end: matches with the expression 'hi', only when it is at the end.

    beginEnd: matches with the expression 'hi', only when it is exactly hi.

 */
const normal = /hi/;

const begin = /^hi/;

const end = /hi$/;

const beginEnd = /^hi$/;
