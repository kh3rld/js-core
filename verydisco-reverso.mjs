/*Instructions

Create a verydisco-reverso.mjs script that:

    takes the name of a file (with the extension) as a first argument
    reads this file
    deciphers the content of this file by reversing it from the very disco mode
    prints the result in the console

For example:

    Reading the verydisco content of your verydisco.txt file would print discovery in console.
